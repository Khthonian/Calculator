# Calculator

## What Does It Do?
This work-in-progress calculator is designed to allow basic operations:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

## What Are the Remaining Tasks?
- The calculator does not yet allow chained operations, e.g. 12 + 5 / 3.
- The delete button needs to be implemented into the operation, to essentially allow a backspace-like functionality.

## Aspirations but Not Necessities?
- The calculator could possibly include keyboard functionality.
